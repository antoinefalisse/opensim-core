Run generate_dll.ps1 with Powershell to build the library (dll) corresponding to the external function F described in your .cpp file. You might need to adjust a few things in the Powershell script depending on how many inputs the function F has and on how things are organized on your computer (paths). You can edit the Powershell script with Notepad++.
